PC Optimizer Tool
What is this?
This is a simple website that generates a powerful, all-in-one script to help clean, repair, and optimize your Windows computer. It's designed to be easy to use, even for people with no technical knowledge.

The main goal is to automate common maintenance tasks that can free up disk space, fix system errors, and potentially improve your PC's overall performance and speed.

This tool was made by Dark.

How to Use
The process is designed to be as simple as possible.

Temporarily Disable Your Antivirus: This is the most important step. Because this script needs to access system files, your antivirus software (like Windows Defender) will likely block it. You must turn off "Real-time protection" before running the script.

Download the Script: Open the website (index.html) and click the "Download Optimizer" button. This will save a file named Optimize.bat to your computer.

Run the Script: Find the downloaded Optimize.bat file and double-click it.

Give Permission: A Windows security window (User Account Control) will pop up. Click "Yes" to allow the script to run with the necessary administrator privileges.

Let it Run: A black command window will appear and automatically perform all the optimization tasks. This can take a while, so please be patient.

Re-enable Your Antivirus: Once the script is finished, it's very important to go back and turn your antivirus protection on again.

What the Script Does
The downloaded Optimize.bat file automatically performs the following tasks in order:

Cleans Temporary Files: It deletes unnecessary junk files from your user, Windows, and Prefetch folders to free up disk space.

Repairs System Files: It runs two powerful Windows tools, SFC (System File Checker) and DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management), to scan for and repair any corrupt or missing core system files.

Optimizes Your Drive: It runs the standard Windows tool to optimize your main C: drive (performing a defragment on HDDs or a TRIM on SSDs).

Flushes DNS Cache: It clears out your computer's DNS cache, which can sometimes help resolve internet connectivity issues.

After all tasks are complete, the script will recommend that you restart your computer to ensure all changes take effect.
